A computer scientist of formation with Ph.D in Nuclear Sciences focused in Monte Carlo and CFD modelling and simulations, looking for a position in which parallel programming as the main duty. Eager to gain practical experience in the field which is my passion since my current position does not demand strong programming skills. My last official project including serious programming was my thesis (2018) where I used shared memory for coupling two software. Despite working in the field of High Performance Computing, few were the chances to dive into heavy C++ programming. However I am sure I can rapidly improve my 'rusty' C++ skills with enthusiasm and put my knowledge in CFD (OpenFOAM), visualization (VTK) and experience in physics simulation to use in this position. Moreover, I have been studying OpenCL, MPI, OpenMP (applying to small personal projects) and, recently, Intel oneAPI - where I have an active account - during the last two years in order to be ready should the opportunity arise. I believe it has.
